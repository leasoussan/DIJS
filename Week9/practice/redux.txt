redux is a STATE MANAGEMENT.
ALl the states will be in one place 
not in class or function componenent 
Its going to be stored in store states
it doesnt mean that we wont have a statae on a componenent
 so most componenet that have the same state will be state of the store 
 we will see how to connect all states, and the actions from the store


 this is a JS file - not componenet 
 create a fil in src - redux.js NOT CAPITAL LETTER


 ACTION > when we have onChange on an imput see app input





 TO IMPLEMENT a redux
 1- index 
 import {createStore} from 'redux';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

//we import the reducer
import { reducer } from './reducer';
const store = createStore(reducer)


2 CREATE  a reducer  like

let initState={
    property_one:'one',
    property_two:'two',
  
}

export const reducer =(state=initState, action={})=>{
    switch (action.type){
        case 'PROP_ONE':
            return {...state, property_one:action.payload};
        case 'PROP_TWO':
            return {...state, property_two:action.payload};

        default:
            return {...state}
    }
}


3 Import the Store in app.js
